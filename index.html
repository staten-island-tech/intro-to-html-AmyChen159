    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Amy Chen and I am a senior. I like to be early and I have a
      free period first so I will likely arrive to class early unless hindered
      by some unforeseen circumstance. I sadly am a Genshin player and cannot
      quit due to the large amount of time and effort I have already invested. I
      have an inability to let thi ngs go and am a major hoarder who think
      everything will eventually be of use eventually despite the leftover
      notebooks from elementary school sitting in my closet currently proving
      otherwise. Now I will proceed to rank my siblings.
    </p>
    <h3>Sibling Ranking</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>my sister (buys me food)</li>
      <li>my brother (does not buy me food)</li>
    </ol>
