    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Amy Chen and I am a senior. I like to be early and I have a
      free period first so I will likely arrive to class early unless hindered
      by some unforeseen circumstance. I have an inability to let things go 
      and am a major hoarder who thinks everything will eventually be of use.
       The stack of notebooks from elementary school, sitting in my closet,
        is currently proving otherwise. Now I will proceed to rank my siblings.
    </p>
    <h3>Sibling Ranking</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>my sister (buys me food)</li>
      <li>my brother (does not buy me food)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Things I like to waste my time on</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Genshin Impact</li>
      <li>Honkai Star Rail</li>
      <li>Mindless Scrolling</li>
      <li>Youtube</li>
      <li>Netflix</li>
      <li>Questionable Anime Websites</li>
    </ul>
